- Securely load secrets in protected in-memory files and environment variables

- Manage multiple environments: `dev`, `preprod`, `prod`... and configure them as you need.

## üîê Security

Secrets are loaded temporarily as environment variables or in a protected `tmpfs` directory and kept only for as long as they are needed.. See [Novops Security Model](./security.html) for details

## Why Novops?

Novops help manage secrets and configurations to avoid keeping them (often insecurely) in gitignored folders, forgotten on your machine and spread around CI and server configs. 

See [Why Novops?](./why-novops.md) for a detailed explanation and history. 

## How is Novops different than other secret management tools? 

- **Universal**: unlike platform-specific tools like `aws-vault`, Novops is designed to be versatile and flexible, meeting a wide range of secret management needs across different platforms and tools.
- **Free and Open Source**, Novops is not trying to sell you a platform or subscription. 
- **Generate temporary credentials** for Clouders like AWS, where most tools only manage static key/value secrets.
- **Manages multi-environment** natively without requiring complex setup like `teller`.
- **Fetch secrets from source** avoiding need for syncing manually with some encrypted file like.
